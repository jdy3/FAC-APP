      <h1>What Judith Did Next</h1>
      <p>Welcome :) This is my first attempt at a website so I hope you enjoy your visit! Please read on and take a look at my projects to get a sense of who I am and what I'm interested in.</p>
      <p>I have a longstanding interest in digitisation, automation and Industry 4.0 in general. With a background in scientific and technological research, I have first-hand experience of the pressing and growing need among research scientists and engineers for big data analytics tools. I'm excited about the potential that Industry 4.0 has to drive down the costs of goods and services, lifting humanity out of poverty and mitigating inequality. I believe that Distributed Ledger Technology in particular could transform the lives of the dis-empowered through decentralisation and democratisation of commerce and other transactions. In essence, I think that technology can help liberate and empower us to express our humanity more fully through culture and community. To that end, I'm hoping to develop and launch a platform that facilitate community co-creation.</p>
      <p>Some of my greatest passions in life include being in nature, yoga and music. I find few things more awe inspiring and comfortingly humbling than a dramatic land or seascape. My yoga practice is a never-ending journey of self-discovery and acceptance; my faithful portal to serenity in this blissfully chaotic city that I call home. I'm fortunate enough to have been part of some amazing choirs in my time - choirs that can floor you with a wall of glorious sound, yet leave you feeling uplifted. And If you've ever shared the intimate communion of an achingly good house track - throbbing baselines overlaid with playfully bouncy or ethereally melancholic melodies - you'll understand why I love to party ;)</p>
